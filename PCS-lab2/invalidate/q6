A cache block is in the exclusive state when the CPU has a unique copy but there have been no writes
on this cache block yet, it's not dirty.
The goal of this state is to lower the amount of writebacks compared to the MI protocol.
For the problem in the MI protocol assume a cache block that has been read, but it hasn't been written to.
When a bus operation or an eviction occurs, this cache block will be written back anyway, even though
this is hasn't changed, this is a useless write back since nothing changed.
