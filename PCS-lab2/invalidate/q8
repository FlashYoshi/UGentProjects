A cacheblock is in the shared state when there are multiple copies of it in the system.
The goal of this state is to reduce the amount of invalidations needed. A bus read will no longer
invalidate the cache block but will instead tag it as shared memory as we know that all cpu's now have
this same cache block. This solves the problem of having to read a lot more than we have to write,
the amount of reads needed is a lot less because we don't have to invalidate as much of that caches
anymore.
