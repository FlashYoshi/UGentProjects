				<h2>OSI and TCP/IP layering differences</h2>
			</header>

			<p>The three top layers in the OSI model—the application layer, the
			presentation layer and the session layer—are not distinguished
			separately in the TCP/IP model where it is just the application
			layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400,
			also combined them, there is no requirement that a TCP/IP protocol
			stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport
			layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the
			eXternal Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in
			turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC
			provides reliable record transmission, so it can run safely over
			the best-effort UDP transport.</p>

			<p>Different authors have interpreted the RFCs differently, about
			whether the link layer (and the TCP/IP model) covers OSI model
			layer 1 (physical layer) issues, or if a hardware layer is assumed
			below the link layer.</p>

			<p>Several authors have attempted to incorporate the OSI model's
			layers 1 and 2 into the TCP/IP model, since these are commonly
			referred to in modern standards (for example, by IEEE and ITU).
			This often results in a model with five layers, where the link
			layer or network access layer is split into the OSI model's layers
			1 and 2.</p>

			<p>The session layer roughly corresponds to the Telnet virtual
			terminal functionality[citation needed], which is part of text
			based protocols such as the HTTP and SMTP TCP/IP model application
			layer protocols. It also corresponds to TCP and UDP port numbering,
			which is considered as part of the transport layer in the TCP/IP
			model. Some functions that would have been performed by an OSI
			presentation layer are realized at the Internet application layer
			using the MIME standard, which is used in application layer
			protocols such as HTTP and SMTP.</p>

			<p>The IETF protocol development effort is not concerned with
			strict layering. Some of its protocols may not fit cleanly into the
			OSI model, although RFCs sometimes refer to it and often use the
			old OSI layer numbers. The IETF has repeatedly stated that Internet
			protocol and architecture development is not intended to be
			OSI-compliant. RFC 3439, addressing Internet architecture, contains
			a section entitled: "Layering Considered Harmful".</p>

			<p>Conflicts are apparent also in the original OSI model, ISO 7498,
			when not considering the annexes to this model (e.g., ISO 7498/4
			Management Framework), or the ISO 8648 Internal Organization of the
			Network layer (IONL). When the IONL and Management Framework
			documents are considered, the ICMP and IGMP are neatly defined as
			layer management protocols for the network layer. In like manner,
			the IONL provides a structure for "subnetwork dependent convergence
			facilities" such as ARP and RARP.</p>

			<p>IETF protocols can be encapsulated recursively, as demonstrated
			by tunneling protocols such as Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE).
			GRE uses the same mechanism that OSI uses for tunneling at the
			network layer.</p>

				<h2>Link layer</h2>
			</header>

			<p>The link layer is the networking scope of the local network
			connection to which a host is attached. This regime is called the
			link in Internet literature. This is the lowest component layer of
			the Internet protocols, as TCP/IP is designed to be hardware
			independent. As a result TCP/IP is able to be implemented on top of
			virtually any hardware networking technology.</p>

			<p>The link layer is used to move packets between the Internet
			layer interfaces of two different hosts on the same link. The
			processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can
			be controlled both in the software device driver for the network
			card, as well as on firmware or specialized chipsets. These will
			perform data link functions such as adding a packet header to
			prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over
			a physical medium. The TCP/IP model includes specifications of
			translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet
			Protocol to data link addressing, such as Media Access Control
			(MAC), however all other aspects below that level are implicitly
			assumed to exist in the link layer, but are not explicitly
			defined.</p>

			<p>This is also the layer where packets may be selected to be sent
			over a virtual private network or other networking tunnel. In this
			scenario, the link layer data may be considered application data
			which traverses another instantiation of the IP stack for
			transmission or reception over another IP connection. Such a
			connection, or virtual link, may be established with a transport
			protocol or even an application scope protocol that serves as a
			tunnel in the link layer of the protocol stack. Thus, the TCP/IP
			model does not dictate a strict hierarchical encapsulation
			sequence.</p>

			<p>The TCP/IP model's link layer corresponds to the Open Systems
			Interconnection (OSI) model physical and data link layers, layers
			one and two of the OSI model.</p>

			<header>
				<h2>Internet layer</h2>
			</header>

			<p>The internet layer has the responsibility of sending packets
			across potentially multiple networks. Internetworking requires
			sending data from the source network to the destination network.
			This process is called routing.</p>

			<p>In the Internet protocol suite, the Internet Protocol performs
			two basic functions:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Host addressing and identification: This is accomplished
				with a hierarchical addressing system (see IP address).</li>

				<li>Packet routing: This is the basic task of sending packets
				of data (datagrams) from source to destination by sending them
				to the next network node (router) closer to the final
				destination.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The internet layer is not only agnostic of application data
			structures at the transport layer, but it also does not distinguish
			between operation of the various transport layer protocols. So, IP
			can carry data for a variety of different upper layer protocols.
			These protocols are each identified by a unique protocol number:
			for example, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Internet
			Group Management Protocol (IGMP) are protocols 1 and 2,
			respectively.</p>

			<p>Some of the protocols carried by IP, such as ICMP (used to
			transmit diagnostic information about IP transmission) and IGMP
			(used to manage IP Multicast data) are layered on top of IP but
			perform internetworking functions. This illustrates the differences
			in the architecture of the TCP/IP stack of the Internet and the OSI
			model. The TCP/IP model's internet layer corresponds to layer three
			of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, where it is
			referred to as the network layer.</p>

			<header>
				<h2>Transport layer</h2>
			</header>

			<p>The transport layer establishes host-to-host connectivity,
			meaning it handles the details of data transmission that are
			independent of the structure of user data and the logistics of
			exchanging information for any particular specific purpose. Its
			responsibility includes end-to-end message transfer independent of
			the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation,
			flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port
			numbers). End to end message transmission or connecting
			applications at the transport layer can be categorized as either
			connection-oriented, implemented in TCP, or connectionless,
			implemented in UDP.</p>

			<p>The transport layer can be thought of as a transport mechanism,
			e.g., a vehicle with the responsibility to make sure that its
			contents (passengers/goods) reach their destination safely and
			soundly, unless another protocol layer is responsible for safe
			delivery. The layer simply establishes a basic data channel that an
			application uses in its task-specific data exchange.</p>

			<p>For this purpose the layer establishes the concept of the port,
			a numbered logical construct allocated specifically for each of the
			communication channels an application needs. For many types of
			services, these port numbers have been standardized so that client
			computers may address specific services of a server computer
			without the involvement of service announcements or directory
			services.</p>

			<p>Since IP provides only a best effort delivery, the transport
			layer is the first layer of the TCP/IP stack to offer reliability.
			IP can run over a reliable data link protocol such as the
			High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC).</p>

			<header>
				<h2>Application layer</h2>
			</header>

			<p>The application layer contains the higher-level protocols used
			by most applications for network communication. Examples of
			application layer protocols include the File Transfer Protocol
			(FTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Data coded
			according to application layer protocols are then encapsulated into
			one or (occasionally) more transport layer protocols (such as TCP
			or UDP), which in turn use lower layer protocols to effect actual
			data transfer.</p>

			<p>Since the IP stack defines no layers between the application and
			transport layers, the application layer must include any protocols
			that act like the OSI's presentation and session layer protocols.
			This is usually done through libraries.</p>

			<p>Application layer protocols generally treat the transport layer
			(and lower) protocols as black boxes which provide a stable network
			connection across which to communicate, although the applications
			are usually aware of key qualities of the transport layer
			connection such as the end point IP addresses and port numbers. As
			noted above, layers are not necessarily clearly defined in the
			Internet protocol suite. Application layer protocols are most often
			associated with client–server applications, and the commoner
			servers have specific ports assigned to them by the IANA: HTTP has
			port 80; Telnet has port 23; etc. Clients, on the other hand, tend
			to use ephemeral ports, i.e. port numbers assigned at random from a
			range set aside for the purpose.</p>

			<p>Transport and lower level layers are largely unconcerned with
			the specifics of application layer protocols. Routers and switches
			do not typically "look inside" the encapsulated traffic to see what
			kind of application protocol it represents, rather they just
			provide a conduit for it. However, some firewall and bandwidth
			throttling applications do try to determine what's inside, as with
			the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). It's also sometimes
			necessary for Network Address Translation (NAT) facilities to take
			account of the needs of particular application layer protocols.
			(NAT allows hosts on private networks to communicate with the
			outside world via a single visible IP address using port
			forwarding, and is an almost ubiquitous feature of modern domestic
			broadband routers).</p>
