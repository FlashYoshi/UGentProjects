				<h2>Software requirements</h2>
			</header>

			<p>No specific hardware or software implementation is required by
			the protocols or the layered model, so there are many. Most
			computer operating systems in use today, including all
			consumer-targeted systems, include a TCP/IP implementation.</p>

			<p>A minimally acceptable implementation includes the following
			protocols, listed from most essential to least essential: IP, ARP,
			ICMP, UDP, TCP and sometimes IGMP. In principle, it is possible to
			support only one transport protocol, such as UDP, but this is
			rarely done, because it limits usage of the whole implementation.
			IPv6, beyond its own version of ARP (NDP), ICMP (ICMPv6) and IGMP
			(IGMPv6), has some additional required functions, and often is
			accompanied by an integrated IPSec security layer. Other protocols
			could be easily added later (possibly being implemented entirely in
			userspace), such as DNS for resolving domain names to IP addresses,
			or DHCP for automatically configuring network interfaces</p>

			<p>Normally, application programmers are concerned only with
			interfaces in the application layer and often also in the transport
			layer, while the layers below are services provided by the TCP/IP
			stack in the operating system. Most IP implementations are
			accessible to programmers through sockets and APIs.</p>

			<p>Unique implementations include Lightweight TCP/IP, an open
			source stack designed for embedded systems, and KA9Q NOS, a stack
			and associated protocols for amateur packet radio systems and
			personal computers connected via serial lines.</p>

			<p>Microcontroller firmware in the network adapter typically
			handles link issues, supported by driver software in the
			operational system. Non-programmable analog and digital electronics
			are normally in charge of the physical components below the link
			layer, typically using an application-specific integrated circuit
			(ASIC) chipset for each network interface or other physical
			standard. High-performance routers are to a large extent based on
			fast non-programmable digital electronics, carrying out link level
			switching.</p>

				<h2>Example of the usage of a TCP/IP communications
				library</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Developer Owen Emlen implemented a high-performance TCP/IP
			library in Java. Here is a quote from his website:</p>

			<blockquote cite=
			"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38374/Design-and-Implementation-of-a-High-performance-TC">
			Okay, enough confusion. For my sake and yours, this is not a
			peer-to-peer project. It's a straightforward client-server TCP/IP
			implementation. Here is how it works:

				<ul>
					<li>The client is responsible for initiating a connection
					to the server. Therefore, the client only needs to process
					and take care of a single outgoing connection.</li>

					<li>The communications server listens for connection
					requests from clients. The communications server must
					process and take care of multiple incoming connection
					requests and incoming connections.</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>

			<p>This step for example will set up the server that will accept
			incoming connections:</p>
			<pre>
<code>
<strong>Java:</strong>
CommunicationsServer server =
new CommServer(IPAddress.Any);
server.BeginListening();
</code>
</pre>
