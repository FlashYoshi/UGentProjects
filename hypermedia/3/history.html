				<h2>Early research</h2>
			</header>

			<p>The Internet protocol suite resulted from research and
			development conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects
			Agency (DARPA) in the early 1970s. After initiating the pioneering
			ARPANET in 1969, DARPA started work on a number of other data
			transmission technologies. In 1972, Robert E. Kahn joined the DARPA
			Information Processing Technology Office, where he worked on both
			satellite packet networks and ground-based radio packet networks,
			and recognized the value of being able to communicate across both.
			In the spring of 1973, Vinton Cerf, the developer of the existing
			ARPANET Network Control Program (NCP) protocol, joined Kahn to work
			on open-architecture interconnection models with the goal of
			designing the next protocol generation for the ARPANET.</p>

			<p>By the summer of 1973, Kahn and Cerf had worked out a
			fundamental reformulation, where the differences between network
			protocols were hidden by using a common internetwork protocol, and,
			instead of the network being responsible for reliability, as in the
			ARPANET, the hosts became responsible. Cerf credits Hubert
			Zimmerman and Louis Pouzin, designer of the CYCLADES network, with
			important influences on this design.</p>

			<p>The network's design included the recognition it should provide
			only the functions of efficiently transmitting and routing traffic
			between end nodes and that all other intelligence should be located
			at the edge of the network, in the end nodes. Using a simple
			design, it became possible to connect almost any network to the
			ARPANET, irrespective of their local characteristics, thereby
			solving Kahn's initial problem. One popular expression is that
			TCP/IP, the eventual product of Cerf and Kahn's work, will run over
			"two tin cans and a string." As a joke, the IP over Avian Carriers
			formal protocol specification was created and successfully
			tested.</p>

			<p>A computer called a router is provided with an interface to each
			network. It forwards packets back and forth between them.
			Originally a router was called gateway, but the term was changed to
			avoid confusion with other types of gateways.</p>

				<h2>Specification</h2>
			</header>

			<p>From 1973 to 1974, Cerf's networking research group at Stanford
			worked out details of the idea, resulting in the first TCP
			specification. A significant technical influence was the early
			networking work at Xerox PARC, which produced the PARC Universal
			Packet protocol suite, much of which existed around that time.</p>

			<p>DARPA then contracted with BBN Technologies, Stanford
			University, and the University College London to develop
			operational versions of the protocol on different hardware
			platforms. Four versions were developed: TCP v1, TCP v2, TCP v3 and
			IP v3, and TCP/IP v4. The last protocol is still in use today.</p>

			<p>In 1975, a two-network TCP/IP communications test was performed
			between Stanford and University College London (UCL). In November,
			1977, a three-network TCP/IP test was conducted between sites in
			the US, the UK, and Norway. Several other TCP/IP prototypes were
			developed at multiple research centers between 1978 and 1983. The
			migration of the ARPANET to TCP/IP was officially completed on flag
			day January 1, 1983, when the new protocols were permanently
			activated.</p>

				<h2>Adoption</h2>
			</header>

			<p><cite title=
			"Ronda Hauben: From the ARPANET to the Internet. TCP Digest (UUCP). Retrieved 2007-07-05.">
			Rando Hauben</cite> stated that in March 1982, the US Department of
			Defense declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer
			networking. In 1985, the Internet Architecture Board held a
			three-day workshop on TCP/IP for the computer industry, attended by
			250 vendor representatives, promoting the protocol and leading to
			its increasing commercial use.</p>

			<p>In 1985, the first Interop conference was held, focusing on
			network interoperability via further adoption of TCP/IP. It was
			founded by Dan Lynch, an early Internet activist. From the
			beginning, it was attended by large corporations, such as IBM and
			DEC. Interoperability conferences have been held every year since
			then. Every year from 1985 through 1993, the number of attendees
			tripled.</p>

			<p>Back then, most of these TCP/IP stacks were written
			single-handedly by a few talented programmers. For example, John
			Romkey of FTP Software was the author of the MIT PC/IP package.[9]
			John Romkey's PC/IP implementation was the first IBM PC TCP/IP
			stack. Jay Elinsky and Oleg Vishnepolsky of IBM Research wrote
			TCP/IP stacks for VM/CMS and OS/2, respectively.</p>

			<p>The spread of TCP/IP was fueled further in June 1989, when
			AT&amp;T agreed to put into the public domain the TCP/IP code
			developed for UNIX. Various vendors, including IBM, included this
			code in their own TCP/IP stacks. Many companies sold TCP/IP stacks
			for Windows until Microsoft released its own TCP/IP stack in
			Windows 95. This event was a little late in the evolution of the
			Internet, but it cemented TCP/IP's dominance over other protocols,
			which eventually disappeared. These protocols included IBM's SNA,
			OSI, Microsoft's native NetBIOS, and Xerox' XNS.</p>
